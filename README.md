# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

## Overview
The **Sorting Algorithm Visualizer** is a Python-based graphical user interface (GUI) application developed using the **Tkinter** library.
This tool visualizes the functioning of various sorting algorithms, providing a dynamic and intuitive representation of how algorithms 
like **Bubble Sort**, **Insertion Sort**, **Selection Sort**, **Merge Sort**, and **Quick Sort** work on an array of numbers. 
The application highlights the sorting process with color-coded bars, allowing users to better understand the performance and behavior of each algorithm.

The visualizer is designed to display the **Time Complexity** and **Space Complexity** of each sorting algorithm.

## Key Features
- **Visual Representation**: Observe sorting algorithms in action with color-coded bars:
  - **Blue**: Elements being processed during the sorting.
  - **Red**: Elements being compared or swapped.
  - **Green**: Sorted elements.
- **Sorting Algorithms Supported**:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
- **Time & Space Complexity**: Displays the **Time Complexity** and **Space Complexity** of each algorithm after execution.
- **Customizable**: Allows users to select different sorting algorithms and watch them sort an array with customizable sizes and delays.

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3.x**: Programming language used for implementation.
- **Tkinter**: GUI framework for creating the application window and rendering the visualizations.
- **Random**: For generating random arrays to be sorted.
